# PersonalWebsite
Responsive personal website to describe myself. Created to showcase
myself to others, so that they can know more about me and the work I do.

Visit at www.anikolic.me

## Content
The website contains a Home page, which directs the user to all other pages.
It also has an "about me" which describes some information about myself, 
and "my projects" which is a gallery of some of my projects. It also includes
a "contact me" page which describes the best ways to get in touch with me.

Additionally, the home page contains links to my relevant social media such as
my Github, Linkedin, etc.

## Implementation

### How it's made
I used HTML to display all my content and CSS to make it look pretty.
In this current build, I used SCSS as a precompiler to generate
compact CSS code.

### Tools
I used Node.js to install and run the SCSS precompiler. I wrote a small npm script
that watches my SCSS files and precompiles them as I write. I also installed the
VS Code Live Server extension to watch my site change as I'm writing the code.
Other than that I used git for version control and VSCode as a file editor.

## Planned Features
I plan on adding ways for visitors to comment on my projects and describe what they think.
I also plan on adding a blog page that I would update once in a while to talk about
my work or what I'm interested in, in terms of technology and programming.

## Suggestions
I am open to any suggestions to improve my website! I am mostly looking for better overall 
design advice, or if there are any ways to improve the code.
